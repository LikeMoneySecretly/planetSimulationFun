# An optional additional project for a university module that I did a while ago
This system plots out some of the planets and attempts to timestep integrate their positions
It doesn't work fully with satellite integration and I never got round to finishing that part off, but it acts as a cool way to see how I design my code. A lot of my later work is private due to a large amount of identifiable features and other code that could get me in trouble, this is just a nice thing that I can keep public without having to worry about what people might do with it :laugh:
